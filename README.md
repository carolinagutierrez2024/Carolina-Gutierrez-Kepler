# Carolina-Gutierrez-Kepler
Portfolio project for Intro to Programming course with Code the Dream

# Carolina Gutierrez – Developer Portfolio

Welcome to my web developer portfolio! This project was built as the final submission for the Code the Dream Intro to Programming course. It highlights the skills I’ve gained in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and introduces who I am as a scientist-turned-developer. Through this project, I explored DOM manipulation, API integration, responsive design, and interactive features.

## About Me

I'm an ecologist and science educator with a passion for building technology that supports access, data analysis, and communication. Through Code the Dream, I’ve begun transitioning my skillset to software development, and this portfolio reflects my ability to build real-world, user-friendly tools with clean, responsive design.
